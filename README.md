## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

This is for a Udacity Data Science Nanodegree Project, and is an analysis of the Seattle AirBnB open data available on Kaggle.

Mainly asking four questions, 
1. What are the busiest times of the year to visit Seattle? By how much do prices spike?
2. Is there a general upward trend of both new Airbnb listings and total Airbnb visitors to Seattle?
3. What aspects correlate well to pricing?
4. What aspects correlate well to rating (review value)?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

1. listings.csv contains data regarding all listings in the Seattle area
2. calendar.csv contains data for all the bookings related to the listings.
3. reviews.csv contains reviews by the customers.


## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the [post](https://medium.com/@janani02dev/a-pocket-friendly-guide-to-the-emerald-city-d00ff9d7114c) available
